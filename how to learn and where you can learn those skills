Recommended learning for either path
 
 1. Git
 One of the most popular version control system. It’s just not possible to live without Git anymore. You can check out The Git Complete Guide on Udemy to start with.
 
 2. SSH
It allows you to remove login to another host, another popular networking concepts which every web developer should know.
 
 3. HTTP / HTTPS
The HTTP protocol is the backbone of web and a good knowledge of both HTTP and HTTPS is mandatory for a web developer
 
 4. Basic Terminal Usage Linux Command line Basics
Not just a web developer but for any programmer, the Linux command line is very very important and I strongly recommend you to spend some time to learn them. The Linux command line basics course on Udemy is a good place to start with and if you like free courses, you can use these free Linux courses to start learning Linux.
 
 5. Data Structures and Algorithms
These are the building blocks of any program and better knowledge of Algorithms and Data Structure is key for your next job or doing well on your current job.

If you are interested in learning algorithms and data structure, I suggest you choose the course which is in the programming language you understand.

For example for Java developers Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java is a good one to start with.

Similarly for JavaScript Developers Colt Steele’s JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass is a good one.

And, if you use Python then Algorithms and Data Structures in Python is a nice one.

And, if you don’t mind learning from resources then you can also use this list of free algorithms courses to start with.
 
 7. Character Encodings
 If you are creating global applications which shows information in many different languages across the world then you should have a good knowledge of character encodings. It basically tells your browser how to show your data.
 
 8. GitHub
 There is no doubt that every programmer should know Git and Github as they are the standard in terms of version control and code repository. If you want to learn and master Git and Github, you can check these free Git course.

The 2019 Frontend Developer RoadMap
If you want to become a front-end developer in 2019 then you should follow the below Front-end Developer RoadMap. You should focus on yellow boxes which highlight important things to learn and follow from there. Below the RoadMap, you will find additional resources like books and courses to aid your learning.



=====================================================================================================================

Front-End

1. Web Development Basics
It’s pretty obvious that if you want to become a Web Developer then you should know the basics of internet, web applications, protocols like HTTP and web development in general. Thankfully there are a lot of courses where you can not only learn these but much more than that.
 
 I recommend the following resources for all programmers who want to learn Web Development:

The Web Developer BootCamp by Colt Steel
The 2019 Complete Web Developer Bootcamp by Angela Yu
The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp
2. HTML and CSS
HTML and CSS are the backbones of any website. HTML provides the structure while CSS provides the style and help them to look better and more visually appealing. If you want to become a serious frontend developer then you must master these two and to start with, you can check these free HTML and CSS courses to learn online.

3. JavaScript
Just like four pillars of object-oriented programming, I mean Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance, there are three main pillars of web development, namely — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
The first two provides structure and style but it’s the JavaScript which makes them alive by adding interactiveness. It’s extremely important for a modern Java developer to learn JavaScript and thankfully there are many courses which you can look to learn both beginner and advanced JavaScript, here are some recommendations:

The Complete JavaScript Course 2019
A Beginner’s Guide to Advanced JavaScript and ES6
4. TypeScript
Just like we have C and C++, TypeScript can be considered as JavaScript++ though it’s not as popular as C++.

The good part of TypeScript is that it adds type-safety in JavaScript code which means you can catch nasty JavaScript type related errors in the development phase.

It also makes developing object-oriented code easily for JavaScript. If you want to learn TypeScript, Understanding TypeScript is a great course to start with and if you need more choices or free alternatives, here is another list of some free TypeScript courses to start with.

5. Angular
Gone are the days when people build websites using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nowadays most of the work is done by a framework like Angular, React JS or Vue.js.
 
 They not only provide a structure for storing your code but also makes it easy to develop a web application in quick time.
 
 Angular is backed by Google, hence learning Angular is a good choice for any modern Web Developer. If you want to learn Angular there is no better course than Max’s Angular 7 (formerly Angular 2) — The Complete Guide on Udemy.


7. React JS
Similar to Angular, React is also a popular library for developing web applications. It allows you to write reusable components which you can then use to create modern looking interactive web pages.

Like Angular is backed by Google, React is backed by Facebook and hence quite popular. If you want to learn React then you either join Stephen Grider’s Modern React with Redux or Max’s React — The Complete Guide on Udemy. Both are excellent courses to learn to React online.
 
 Here are the links:

Modern React with Redux
React — The Complete Guide
8. Vue.js
The Vue or Vue JS has really picked up speed last year and more and more people are recommending and using Vue.js. I am still a beginner on Vue and probably take some time to learn and migrate into Vue based application. But, if you have already made a decision you can start with Vue.js Essentials course on Udemy.


============================================================================================================================

Back-End

1. Node.js
There are many choices to develop your web application’s backend e.g. you can use Java and Spring or maybe Python + Django but in recent year Node.js has come up as the preferred option.

The best thing about NodeJS is that it allows you to develop a complete web application using just one programming language — JavaScript.

If you want to go Node route, then The Complete Node.js Developer course by Rob Percival and Andrew Mead is best to start with.

2. Java
I am primarily a Java developer who have learned Web Development and other programming languages, hence when it comes to developing backend my preferred choice is Java. You can either use Core Java or Java + Spring Boot to write a cutting edge, high-performance backend. If you want to go Java and Spring route, here are a couple of courses you can join to get up-to-speed.

The Complete Java Masterclass
Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru
3. Python
Python is another awesome language, full of powerful framework and libraries. If you want to develop backend using Python then you can use Django, a full-stack web development framework for Python programmers.

To start with here are a couple of courses to learn Python and Django:

The Complete Python Bootcamp
Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp
4. Ruby
Ruby is another powerful language perfect for web development. It has got a great framework called Rails which makes creating Web applications really easy and fast. If you want to start with Ruby you can check out The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course on Udemy.


It’s one of the best resources and if you need more choices and don’t mind learning from free resources, you can also take a look at these free Ruby and Rails courses.

5. PHP and MySQL
Forget about whatever negative things people say about PHP. It is still the easiest way to write the server side code and many, almost 50% of the internet runs on PHP and MySQL stack.

If you are interested in learning PHP, you can check out PHP for Beginners course on Udemy. If you need more choices and free resources, you can also check my list of free PHP and MySQL courses to start with.


That’s all about how to become a Web Developer in 2019. This is an excellent resource to start with as it highlights several paths to become the Web developer you always wanted to be.

Though, if you stuck somewhere and if there is any confusion, you can always ask here and we’ll try to answer your queries as best as possible.
 
If you are new into the programming world, don’t let this illustration and a lot of technologies scare you. It’s just a guideline and you can take a different path to learn Web Development and become a Web Developer, you can choose the path you like and stick to that.
